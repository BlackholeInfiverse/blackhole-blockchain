## üìä **Key Metrics to Highlight**

During recording, emphasize these metrics:

- **Transaction Count**: Total processed transactions
- **Replay Protection**: Events recorded and duplicates prevented  
- **Cross-Chain Relays**: Successful bridge transfers
- **Response Time**: Speed of transaction detection and processing
- **Error Handling**: Recovery system and retry mechanisms
- **Security**: Hash validation and duplicate prevention

## üîß **Technical Details to Mention**

- **Testnet Networks**: Ethereum Sepolia, Solana Devnet
- **Real RPC Connections**: Live blockchain monitoring

- **Retry Mechanisms**: Robust error handling

## üìù **Recording Tips**

### **Audio**
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Explain technical concepts simply
- Highlight key achievements
- Mention security features

### **Visual**
- Keep terminal text readable (large font)
- Show full URLs and transaction hashes
- Highlight important log messages
- Switch between terminals smoothly

### **Timing**
- Allow time for transactions to confirm
- Don't rush through deployment steps
- Show loading/waiting states
- Pause for dramatic effect on successes

## üö® **Troubleshooting During Recording**

### **Common Issues**
- **RPC Connection Failures**: Switch to simulation mode
- **Low Testnet Balances**: Use faucets or pre-fund wallets
- **Transaction Delays**: Explain testnet congestion
- **Build Errors**: Have backup compiled binaries

### **Recovery Strategies**
- Keep backup terminals open
- Have pre-deployed contracts ready
- Use simulation mode if needed
- Explain issues as learning opportunities

## üìÅ **Post-Recording Deliverables**

After recording, provide:

1. **Video File**: High-quality MP4 format
2. **Configuration Files**: All deployment configs
3. **Transaction Logs**: Complete bridge logs
4. **Screenshots**: Key moments and results
5. **Documentation**: This guide and setup instructions

## üéØ **Success Criteria**
