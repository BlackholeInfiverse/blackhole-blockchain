4-Day Consolidation Sprint Plan (v0.2-testnet Ready)
ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal:
Deploy token & coin to the DEX with working swap, bridge, staking, and freeze/violation
enforcement. Push v0.2-testnet tag and run live audit session.
Day 1: Patch & Sync
All focus on unimplemented/half-complete modules. Target: feature parity across devs.
Shivam
â€¢ Final review of mintBurnHandler event logs â†’ ensure it emits structured event logs for
relay.
â€¢ Add getAuditTrail(address) API for token history (supports AI/ML audit).
â€¢ Refactor adminOverride to be chain-safe (signed multisig required).
Shantanu
â€¢ Finalize gRPC schemas (bridge/api-schema.proto)
â€¢ Complete /log/retry, /log/status endpoints and test them
â€¢ Simulate ETH â†’ BH â†’ SOL + vice versa with logs, 2 chains â†’ 1 listener proof.
Nihal
â€¢ Run DEX slippage edge case test (swap with large delta, tiny liquidity).
â€¢ Add slippage protection to pool contract.
â€¢ Test OTC trade failure + multi-sig override (3/5 signers)
Keval & Aryan
â€¢ Rebuild Cybercrime.sol (core freeze, report, unfreeze logic)
â€¢ Hook into Shivamâ€™s /token/transfer for enforcement triggers
â€¢ Test freeze() â†’ event â†’ bridge replay â†’ confirm token transfer block.
Yashika
â€¢ Begin off-chain ML logic stub for violation detection (e.g. anomalous swap, flash dump).
â€¢ Output JSON with format:
{
"address": "0x123...",
"violation": "Rapid token dump",
"score": 0.87,
"recommended_action": "freeze"
}
â€¢ Sync with Keval to format logs for real-time detection
Day 2: End-to-End Chain Test + AI Enforcement
Run full simulation from wallet to DEX to bridge to cybercrime trigger.
Shivam
â€¢ Push /token-audit endpoint to return full transfer history
â€¢ Confirm approve() to bridge / stake triggers log emission
Shantanu
â€¢ Log latency of bridge events
â€¢ Test retry + fallback from simulated dropped event
Nihal
â€¢ Simulate flash attack â†’ verify DEX recovers gracefully
â€¢ Dump DEX state before/after attack â†’ share with Yashika
Keval & Aryan
â€¢ Deploy cybercrime contract to local + testnet
â€¢ Simulate 2 violations and 1 false positive
â€¢ Record logs, freeze/unfreeze triggers
Yashika
â€¢ Run detection logic on dump event
â€¢ Trigger freeze recommendation to CyberCrime.sol
â€¢ Write ml-detection.md explaining how system scores and recommends
Day 3: Dockerize, PR Freeze, Final Integration
Prepare the full system for clean deploy.
All Devs
â€¢ Ensure Dockerfile exists for every microservice.
â€¢ Push all final commits to dev â†’ raise PR to main with full test logs
â€¢ Run E2E CLI test:
mint â†’ approve â†’ stake â†’ swap â†’ bridge â†’ cybercrime
Vinayak
â€¢ Clone and test every Docker container
â€¢ Practice merging one branch + resolving PR conflicts
â€¢ Prepare GitHub Actions to auto-lint or test if possible
Day 4: Final Audit +
v0.2-testnet
Launch
Tag testnet release and prepare full walkthrough/demo.
All Devs
â€¢ Run testnet simulation (screen-recorded)
â€¢ Push v0.2-testnet tag
â€¢ Prepare 1-pager per module:
â—¦ Shivam â†’ token-events.md
â—¦ Shantanu â†’ bridge-api.md
â—¦ Nihal â†’ dex-api.md
â—¦ Keval â†’ cybercrime-cli.md
â—¦ Yashika â†’ ml-detection.md
Vinayak (test capability along with the team)
â€¢ Observe testnet launch
â€¢ Write first draft of docker-readme.md for deploying whole system locally
What This Unlocks:
â€¢ v0.2-testnet â†’ usable token, DEX, bridge, freeze
â€¢ Ready to mint/distribute coin on testnet via faucet
â€¢ Full AI-flag â†’ smart contract enforcement flow in place
â€¢ Next step: build Cybercrime dashboard, real-time audit engine, bridge deployment
