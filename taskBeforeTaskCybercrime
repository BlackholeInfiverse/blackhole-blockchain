Scoring Matrix (Per Dev)
Total: 10 per dev – All are expected to score 8.5+ minimum to proceed
to Mainnet Simulation Phase.
Here’s the step-by-step 5-day sprint breakdown for each dev, with tasks stacked logically and with
performance expectations. This is designed to ensure high throughput, clear interdependencies, and
merge-readiness by Day 5.
